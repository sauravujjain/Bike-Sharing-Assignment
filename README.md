General Information
This project aims to predict the demand for bike sharing based on various factors such as weather conditions, season, and other features. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about bike sharing on different days, including variables like temperature, humidity, windspeed, and the number of bikes rented.

Conclusions
The analysis reveals a positive correlation between the target variable ("cnt") and features like temperature, humidity, windspeed, and season.
Through feature selection techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), a subset of important features was identified for the final model.
The final linear regression model achieved an adjusted R-squared value of 83.8%, indicating a good fit to the data.
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both the training and test datasets was close to 0, indicating accurate predictions.
